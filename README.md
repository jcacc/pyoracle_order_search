# pyoracle_order_search
a python script to search a bunch of order numbers from an Oracle database

I was tasked with taking a CSV file with over 4,000 order numbers that I needed to search for in our ERP system, which has an Oracle backend. Order numbers are extracted from a CSV and stored to a list. THere's probably a cleaner way to do this with actual Oracle PL/SQL commands, but I like to keep my hands off the inner workings. I'm a sysadmin, not a dba :-)
